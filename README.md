# PARAXA

**PARAXA** is a next-generation infrastructure layer for autonomous AI agents, enabling verifiable inference, seamless x402 payments, and coordinated multi-agent execution across decentralized environments.

---

## Overview

PARAXA provides the foundational stack required to deploy, verify, and monetize autonomous agents at scale.  
It bridges artificial intelligence, cryptographic verification, and programmable payments into a unified, trust-minimized system.

Designed for builders, researchers, and protocol developers, PARAXA enables agents that can **reason, act, coordinate, and get paid**—all on-chain or in verifiable off-chain environments.

- Pay-per-inference, pay-per-action, or streaming payments
- Designed for autonomous agent monetization

### 🤝 Agent Coordination Layer
- Multi-agent communication and task orchestration
- Autonomous agent-to-agent interactions
- Deterministic execution and coordination logic

### 🧩 Modular Infrastructure
- Chain-agnostic design
- Pluggable inference engines and payment modules
- Built for scalability and composability

## How It Works

1. **Agent Deployment**  
   Autonomous agents are deployed using PARAXA-compatible execution environments.

2. **Inference Execution**  
   Agents perform AI inference with cryptographic proofs ensuring result integrity.

3. **Verification**  
   Inference outputs are verified using PARAXA’s verification layer.

4. **Payment Settlement**  
   x402 payments are triggered automatically based on inference, actions, or coordination outcomes.

5. **Agent Coordination**  
   Agents communicate, negotiate, and execute tasks collaboratively.
